# x3-fixed-size-array-list-f21

This example implements a List ADT using a fixed size array.  The capacity of the array is passed as a parameter to the constructor and never changes while the list is in use.
This list does obey the *rule of three* so implements a destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment operator.
